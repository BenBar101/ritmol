# RITMOL

A gamified life companion PWA for STEM university students. Solo Leveling RPG aesthetic. Black and white. No server — runs entirely in your browser. **Stack:** React, Vite; data lives in **localStorage**. All application logic and UI live in **`src/App.jsx`**. Sync across devices by **reading and writing a single JSON file** with [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) via the browser File System Access API.

### Project structure

- **`src/App.jsx`** — all app logic, UI, sync, and auth.
- **`index.html`** — entry point; includes SPA redirect handling for GitHub Pages.
- **`vite.config.js`** — Vite config; `base` is set from `VITE_BASE_PATH` (e.g. repo name for GitHub Pages).
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** — GitHub Actions workflow: build with repo Variables, deploy `dist` to Pages.
- **`api/verify-google-id.js`** — optional serverless JWT verification (e.g. Vercel); used when `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL` is set.
- **`manifest.json`**, **`sw.js`** — PWA manifest and service worker.
- **`404.html`** — redirects 404s to the SPA so client-side routes and OAuth callbacks work on GitHub Pages.

## Design Philosophy & Security Model

**RITMOL is intentionally a single-user, self-hosted application.**

The app is designed for one person running it on multiple devices using a static host (e.g. GitHub Pages). It does **not** aim to support multiple users or enterprise-grade authentication.

Because the app runs entirely in the browser and is open source, some API keys (such as the Gemini key) are included in the frontend build via environment variables. This is **acceptable for the intended use case** because:

* the **deployer** (repo owner) sets the Gemini key in **GitHub repository Variables** — end users do not enter API keys in the app
* keys are **not committed to the repository**
* the app is **not a public multi-user service**

### Threat Model

The intended deployment model is:

```
Your devices  ←→  Syncthing  ←→  one JSON file (your data)
                     ↑
              GitHub Pages (static site only)
```

There is **no backend server** and no central database. Sync is **file-based**: you export/import (or point the app at) a single JSON file that Syncthing keeps in sync across your machines.

Therefore:

* Authentication gates (Google sign-in) are **convenience access filters**, not strong security guarantees.
* API keys embedded in the frontend bundle are acceptable when restricted in the provider dashboard.
* The app assumes **a trusted user environment**.

### Important Rules

When cloning or deploying:

1. **Never commit `.env` files or API keys**
2. For AI features, set the **Gemini API key** (`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`) in **GitHub repo Variables** (deploy) or in `.env` (local dev) — it is never entered in the app UI
3. For the **sign-in gate** in production, set **at least** `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in GitHub repo Variables (see **How to get the Google Client ID and set GitHub Variables** below). Optionally add `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL` if you deploy the verify endpoint.
4. Optionally restrict the Gemini key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (API restrictions → Gemini only; optionally add an HTTP referrer for your domain)

### Non-Goals

The project intentionally avoids:

* backend servers
* databases
* complex authentication systems
* multi-user support
* enterprise security infrastructure
* third-party cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

Contributors and automated tools should **not** add server components or cloud sync services unless the project scope changes. The goal is to keep the system **simple, portable, and peer-to-peer friendly**.

---

**Access control:** The app is single-user. In **production** the Google sign-in gate is always on (fail-closed). Only the Google account set in `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` can use the app. The sign-in session is stored in **sessionStorage** (tab-scoped); closing the tab logs you out. Set **at least** `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in your environment (e.g. GitHub Actions Variables or `.env`); never commit secrets. **No server is required** — the app validates the Google token in the browser. Optionally, set `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL` to a deployed JWT verification endpoint for stronger security. In **local dev**, leave `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` and `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` empty to run without the gate; if you set either one, you must set both or the app shows a configuration error. After too many failed sign-in attempts the gate asks you to refresh the page.

**API keys:** The Gemini API key (`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`) is supplied via **GitHub repository Variables** for the deployed build (set by the repo owner in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables). For local dev it comes from `.env`. It is **not** entered by users in the app. See `.env.example` and the deploy section below. The app enforces a **daily token budget** for Gemini (shown as “neural energy” in the UI); when exhausted, AI features (chat, gacha, daily quote, etc.) are disabled until the next day.

## After cloning

1. **Clone and enter the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ritmol.git
   cd ritmol
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`. For **single-account access**, also set `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` and `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; to run **without the gate**, leave those two empty. Never put real secrets in the repo.

4. **(Optional) Local `.env` reference**  
   All config can live in `.env` for local dev. The deployed build uses **GitHub repo Variables** only (no `.env`). See `.env.example` for every variable.

## Sync: Syncthing + File System Access API

Data is stored in **localStorage**. To use the same data on multiple devices, RITMOL uses the browser's [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) to read and write a JSON file directly on disk — no OAuth, no cloud accounts, no API keys.

### How it works

1. **Install Syncthing** on all your devices from [syncthing.net](https://syncthing.net/). Create a shared folder (e.g. `~/ritmol-sync/`) and share it between your devices.
2. **On first use**, go to **Profile → Settings → SYNCTHING SYNC** and click **LINK SYNCTHING FILE**. Pick (or create) `ritmol-data.json` inside your Syncthing folder. The browser remembers this file handle across sessions.
3. **Push ↑** — writes your current data to the file. Syncthing picks it up and distributes it to your other devices.
4. **Pull ↓** — reads the file that Syncthing has updated from another device and loads it into the app.
5. The app also **auto-pushes** when you switch tabs or close the browser, so your file is always up to date.

> **Browser support:** File System Access API works in **Chrome and Edge** (desktop). Firefox and iOS Safari do not support it. On unsupported browsers, the app falls back to **Download** (saves a JSON file) and **Import** (loads a JSON file via file picker). You move the downloaded file to your Syncthing folder manually in that case.

The sync file must be **valid JSON** and may not exceed **10 MB**. If you Pull or Import a corrupt or oversized file, the app shows an error and does not overwrite your local data.

### Implementation notes (sync & security)

The app applies a number of safeguards documented in code comments in `src/App.jsx`:

- **Sync:** Corrupt or oversized sync files are rejected (no tab crash). Only allowlisted keys (`SYNC_KEYS`) are written from sync; API keys are never synced. Incoming payloads are validated with `SYNC_VALIDATORS` per key. Timers and habit suggestions are included in the sync payload and in flush-to-storage. Dev and prod use separate localStorage prefixes and **separate sync file handles** (different IndexedDB key); in dev you can link a test file and use **Pull** to refresh the dev copy without affecting production. Before each Push (manual or auto-push on tab hide), the app **flushes the latest in-memory state to localStorage** so the sync file always reflects current data. The sync file handle is stored in **IndexedDB**; the DB connection is **cached and reused** (and cleared on error so the next call retries) for reliability on low-end devices.
- **Auth:** Google JWT payload is validated (iss, aud, exp, email_verified); malformed tokens are rejected. The in-app session (nonce in sessionStorage) is a **UX guard**, not a strong security boundary; the **trust anchor** is the Google-signed JWT verified above. Sign-in retry is rate-limited; the failure counter resets on success. Unlinking the sync file uses an in-app confirmation (no `window.confirm`) for PWA compatibility.
- **AI safety:** All user-supplied and prompt data (profile, tasks, goals, habits, data tables sent to the AI) is **sanitized** to reduce JSON/prompt injection. Token usage is capped per day; AI-awarded XP is capped per day to prevent runaway accumulation.

### Onboarding (new device)

The last step of the onboarding wizard prompts you to link your Syncthing file. You can skip this and do it later in **Profile → Settings**.

## Deploy: GitHub Pages (recommended, free)

**Checklist:** Push repo → enable Pages from GitHub Actions → add **GitHub repo Variables** for `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`. Optionally add `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL` if you deploy the JWT verification endpoint (see below). No `.env` file is used for the deployed build.

**Live site config:** Set the variables below under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**. No `.env` file is used for the deployed build; the workflow reads them from GitHub Variables. In production the sign-in gate is always enforced. **No server required** — you only need `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` and `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; the app validates the Google token in the browser. Optionally add a verify endpoint for stronger security (see below).

### 1 — Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ritmol.git
git push -u origin main
```

**If you rewrote history** (e.g. to remove a committed secret): use `git push --force origin main`. Only force-push when you're sure no one else is building on the old history.

### 2 — Enable GitHub Pages

1. Repo → **Settings → Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not “Deploy from a branch”).
3. The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `main`.

**If the page is blank** and the console shows a disallowed MIME type for `App.jsx` → the site is serving source instead of the built app. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**, then push a commit so the workflow deploys the `dist` folder.

### 3 — Base path

The workflow sets `VITE_BASE_PATH` from your repo name. The app is served at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/`. No change needed.

### 4 — Restrict access (single Google account) and set GitHub Variables

Only the Google account in `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` can use the app. In production the gate is always on. **You do not need a server** — set the two auth variables and the app validates the Google token in the browser (iss, aud, exp, email_verified). Optionally, for stronger security, you can deploy the JWT verification endpoint and set `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL`.

#### How to get the Google Client ID and set GitHub Variables

1. **Get a Google OAuth Client ID (Web application)**  
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
   - Click the project dropdown at the top → **New Project** (or select an existing one).  
   - Open **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**.  
   - Click **+ Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**.  
   - If prompted, set the OAuth consent screen (e.g. External, add your email as test user).  
   - Application type: **Web application**.  
   - Name it (e.g. "RITMOL").  
   - Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
     - Your GitHub Pages URL: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io` (and if you use a custom domain, add it too).  
     - For local dev: `http://localhost:5173`.  
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs** you can leave empty for the Google Identity Services (GIS) one-tap flow used by RITMOL.  
   - Click **Create**. Copy the **Client ID** (looks like `xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`).  

2. **Add GitHub repository Variables**  
   In your repo go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** and add:

   | Variable | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` | Your Google account email (the only account that can sign in). |
   | `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | The Web application Client ID from step 1 (e.g. `xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com`). |
   | `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). The deployed app gets this from GitHub Variables; users do not enter it in the app. |

   That’s enough to run the sign-in gate with browser-side validation. Push a commit so the workflow rebuilds.

3. **(Optional) Stronger security: JWT verification endpoint**  
   If you want server-side verification of the Google token (recommended for higher assurance, not required):
   - Deploy the repo’s `api/verify-google-id.js` to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (or another serverless platform).  
   - In the function’s environment, set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (or `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`) to the **same** Client ID from step 1.  
   - Add a fourth variable: `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL` = the public URL of your deployed function (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/verify-google-id`).

**Security note:** Without a verify endpoint, the app decodes the Google ID token in the browser and validates claims (iss, aud, exp, email_verified). That is fine for a single-user personal app. If you set `VITE_VERIFY_GOOGLE_ID_URL`, the app sends the token to your serverless function, which verifies the JWT signature with Google’s public keys for stronger assurance.

## Local Dev

The app shows a **configuration screen** until `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in the environment (GitHub Variables or `.env`). Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5173
```

For **single-account access**, create a `.env` from `.env.example` and set `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`. To run **without the sign-in gate**, leave `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAIL` and `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` empty; you still need the Gemini key.

To test the production build locally, run `npm run build` then `npm run preview`.

**Dev mode protects your real data:** When you run `npm run dev`, the app uses a **separate localStorage copy** for all its own keys (prefixed with `ritmol_dev_`) and a **separate sync file handle** (stored under a different IndexedDB key). Caches and app data are isolated from production. Use **Pull** in Profile → Settings to refresh the dev copy from your Syncthing file. A yellow **DEV MODE** bar at the top reminds you.
